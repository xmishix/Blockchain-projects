# Report of assignment
This is the report for assignment 2. I will be implementing the Optional Tasks later.

## Part A -- Deployment


## Part B -- Transaction Details (tx1/tx2/tx3)


## Part C -- Fee Comparison (tx1 vs tx2)
Look at the screenshots at the bottom, and youâ€™ll see that tx1 landed first (followed by tx2, then tx3).

For effective gas price and priority tip:
- tx1
  * Effective gas price: 1,769,606,477 wei
  * Priority fee: 1,000,000,000 wei
- tx2
  * Effective gas price: 3,673,578,355 wei
  * Priority fee: 3,000,000,000 wei
- tx3
  * Effective gas price: 2,589,532,201 wei
  * Priority fee: 2,000,000,000 wei
-> tx2 had the highest effective gas price and the highest priority fee (tip).

Brief EIP-1559 explanation (bsse fee + tip):
  **Base Fee**:
    - A mandatory minimum per-gas price set by the network.
    - It adjusts up or down depending on the block congestion.
    - This fee is burned (destroyed), reducing ETH supply.
  **Priority Fee (Tip)**:
    - An additional amount a user offers to miners/validators as an incentive to include their transaction quickly.
    - A higher tip increases the chance of faster inclusion.
  **Max Fee Per Gas**:
    - The maximum amount a user is willing to pay per unit of gas.
    - The actual cost = Base Fee + Priority Fee, capped by the Max Fee.

    
## Part D -- Decimals & Conversion
Example: 'Transfer' event in tx1
- Raw value (wei):
  100000000000000000000
- Human-readable (divided by 1e18):
  100.0
