## Reflection
During this activity/assignment, I learned how to build a blockchain from the ground up and how to create transactions within the network. I also got to experience firsthand the transparency that blockchain technology provides. One of the most striking demonstrations was observing how the system immediately shows a false validation when someone attempts to tamper with the blockchain data, which reinforces the fundamental concept of immutability that makes blockchain so revolutionary.

The Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism is what makes blockchain inherently secure and trustworthy. For a malicious actor to successfully alter the blockchain, they would need to recreate all of the computational work that went into mining every subsequent block after their point of tampering. This process would require enormous computational resources and time, and even if accomplished, the resulting chain would be completely different from the legitimate one that the rest of the network recognizes. This computational barrier makes blockchain practically tamper-proof, as the cost and effort required to attack the system far exceed any potential benefits a bad actor might gain.

Additionally, this hands-on experience helped me understand why blockchain is considered a paradigm shift in how we think about data integrity, trust, and decentralized systems. The mathematical and cryptographic foundations ensure that once data is recorded, it becomes part of an immutable historical record that can be verified by anyone in the network.
